        <p>This property describes the naming or identification of any real-world item by a name or any other identifier. </p>
        <p>This property is intended for identifiers in general use, which form part of the world the model intends to describe, and not merely for internal database identifiers which are specific to a technical system, unless these latter also have a more general use outside the technical context. This property includes in particular identification by mathematical expressions such as coordinate systems used for the identification of instances of E53 Place. The property does not reveal anything about when, where and by whom this identifier was used. A more detailed representation can be made using the fully developed (i.e., indirect) path through E15 Identifier Assignment.</p>
        <p>
          This property is a shortcut for the path from E1 CRM Entity through <em>P140i was attributed by</em>, E15 Identifier Assignment, <em>P37 assigned </em>to<em> </em>E42 Identifier.
        </p>
        <p>
          It is also a shortcut for the path from E1 CRM Entity through <em>P1 is identified by</em>, E41 Appellation, <em>P139 has alternative form</em> to E41 Appellation.

        <p>This property allows sub typing of CIDOC CRM entities –a form of specialisation – through the use of a terminological hierarchy, or thesaurus. </p>
        <p>The CIDOC CRM is intended to focus on the high-level entities and relationships needed to describe data structures. Consequently, it does not specialise entities any further than is required for this immediate purpose. However, entities in the isA hierarchy of the CIDOC CRM may by specialised into any number of sub entities, which can be defined in the E55 Type hierarchy. E41 Appellation, for example, may be specialised into “e-mail address”, “telephone number”, “post office box”, “URL” etc. none of which figures explicitly in the CIDOC CRM hierarchy. A comprehensive explanation about refining CIDOC CRM concepts by E55 Type is given in the section “About Types” in the section on “Specific Modelling Constructs” of this document.</p>
        <p>
          This property is a shortcut for the path from E1 CRM Entity through <em>P41i was classified by, </em>E17 Type Assignment, <em>P42 assigned </em>to<em> </em>E55 Type.

        <p>This property is a container for all informal descriptions about an object that have not been expressed in terms of CIDOC CRM constructs. </p>
        <p>In particular, it captures the characterisation of the item itself, its internal structures, appearance etc.</p>
        <p>
          Like property <em>P2 has type (is type of)</em>, this property is a consequence of the restricted focus of the CIDOC CRM. The aim is not to capture, in a structured form, everything that can be said about an item; indeed, the CIDOC CRM formalism is not regarded as sufficient to express everything that can be said. Good practice requires use of distinct note fields for different aspects of a characterisation. The <em>P3.1 has type </em>property of <em>P3 has note</em> allows differentiation of specific notes, e.g., “construction”, “decoration” etc.
        </p>
        <p>An item may have many notes, but a note is attached to a specific item.</p>

        <p>This property describes the spatial location of an instance of E4 Period. </p>
        <p>
          The related instance of E53 Place should be seen as a wider approximation of the geometric area within which the phenomena that characterise the period in question occurred, see below. <em>P7 took place at (witnessed)</em> does not convey any meaning other than spatial positioning (frequently on the surface of the earth). For example, the period “Révolution française” can be said to have taken place in “France in 1789”; the “Victorian” period may be said to have taken place in “Britain from 1837-1901” and its colonies, as well as other parts of Europe and North America. An instance of E4 Period can take place at multiple non-contiguous, non-overlapping locations.
        </p>
        <p>
          This property is a shortcut of the more fully developed path from E4 Period through <em>P161 has spatial projection</em>, E53 Place,<em> P89 falls within </em>to E53 Place. E4 Period is a subclass of E92 Spacetime Volume. By the definition of <em>P161 has spatial projection</em> an instance of E4 Period takes place on all its spatial projections, that is, instances of E53 Place. Something happening at a given place can also be considered to happen at a larger place containing the first. For example, the assault on the Bastille 14<sup>th</sup> July 1789 took place in the area covered by Paris in 1789 but also in the area covered by France in 1789.

        <p>E54 Dimension can be any quantifiable aspect of E70 Thing. Weight, image colour depth and monetary value are dimensions in this sense. One measurement activity may determine more than one dimension of one object.</p>

        <p>Component elements, since they are themselves instances of E18 Physical Thing, may be further analysed into sub-components, thereby creating a hierarchy of part decomposition.

          This property generalises relationships like whole-part, sequence, prerequisite or inspired by between instances of E29 Design or Procedure. Any instance of E29 Design or Procedure may be associated with other designs or procedures. The property is considered to be symmetrical unless otherwise indicated by <em>P69.1 has type</em>. The property is not transitive
        </p>
        <p>
          This property is a directed relationship. The <em>P69.1 has type</em> property of <em>P69 has association</em> <em>with</em> allows the nature of the association to be specified reading from domain to range; examples of types of association between instances of E29 Design or Procedure include: has part, follows, requires, etc.

        <p>Instances of this property are considered to be symmetric, in case no directed sense is provided for them by the property P69.1 has type.</p>
        <p>The property can typically be used to model the decomposition of the description of a complete workflow into a series of separate procedures. </p>

        <p>This property generalises the notions of "copy of" and "similar to" into a directed relationship, where the domain expresses the derivative or influenced item and the range the source or influencing item, if such a direction can be established. The property can also be used to express similarity in cases that can be stated between two objects only, without historical knowledge about its reasons. The property expresses a symmetric relationship in case no direction of influence can be established either from evidence on the item itself or from historical knowledge. This holds in particular for siblings of a derivation process from a common source or non-causal cultural parallels, such as some weaving patterns.</p>
        <p>
          The <em>P130.1</em> <em>kind of similarity</em> property of the <em>P130 shows features of (features are also found on)</em> property enables the relationship between the domain and the range to be further clarified, in the sense from domain to range, if applicable. For example, it may be expressed if both items are product “of the same mould”, or if two texts “contain identical paragraphs”.
        </p>
        <p>
          If the reason for similarity is a sort of derivation process, i.e., that the creator has used or had in mind the form of a particular thing during the creation or production, this process should be explicitly modelled. In these cases, <em>P130 shows features of </em>can be regarded as a shortcut of such a process. However, the current model does not contain any path specific enough to infer this property. Specializations of the CIDOC CRM may however be more explicit, for instance describing the use of moulds etc.

          This property describes the largest volume in space, an instance of E53 Place, that an instance of E18 Physical Thing has occupied at any time during its existence, with respect to the reference space relative to the physical thing itself. This allows for describing the thing itself as a place that may contain other things, such as a box that may contain coins. In other words, it is the volume that contains all the points which the thing has covered at some time during its existence. The reference space for the associated place must be the one that is permanently at rest (<em>P157 is at rest relative to)</em> relative to the physical thing. For instances of E19 Physical Objects it is the one which is at rest relative to the object itself, i.e., which moves together with the object. For instances of E26 Physical Feature it is one which is at rest relative to the physical feature itself and the surrounding matter immediately connected to it. Therefore, there is a 1:1 relation between the instance E18 Physical Thing and the instance of E53 Place it occupies. We include in the occupied space the space filled by the matter of the physical thing and all its inner spaces.

          This property implies the fully developed path from E18 Physical Thing through <em>P196 defines, </em>E92 Spacetime Volume,<em> P161 has spatial projection</em> to E53 Place. However, in contrast to <em>P156 occupies,</em> the property <em>P161 has spatial projection</em> does not constrain the reference space of the referred instance of E53 Place.
        </p>
        <p>
          In contrast to <em>P156 occupies</em>, for the property <em>P53 has former or current location</em> the following holds:
        </p>
        <p>It does not constrain the reference space of the referred instance of E53 Place. </p>
        <p>It identifies a possibly wider instance of E53 Place at which a thing is or has been for some unspecified time-span. </p>
        <p>
          If the reference space of the referred instance of E53 Place is not at rest with respect to the physical thing found there, the physical thing may move away after some time to another place and/or may have been at some other place before. The same holds for the fully developed path from E18 Physical Thing through <em>P196 defines</em>, E92 Spacetime Volume,<em> P161 has spatial projection</em> to E53 Place.

The relative stability of form of an instance of E18 Physical Thing defines its default reference space. The reference space is not spatially limited to the referred thing. For example, a ship determines a reference space in terms of which other ships in its neighbourhood may be described.

        <p>
          In general, there can be more than one useful reference space (for reference space see <em>P156 occupies</em> and <em>P157 is at rest relative to</em>) to describe the spatial projection of a spacetime volume, for example, in describing a sea battle, the difference between the battle ship and the seafloor as reference spaces. Thus, it can be seen that the projection is not unique.
        </p>
        <p>The spatial projection is the actual spatial coverage of a spacetime volume, which normally has fuzzy boundaries except for instances of E92 Spacetime Volumes which are geometrically defined in the same reference system as the range of this property are an exception to this and do not have fuzzy boundaries. Modelling explicitly fuzzy spatial projections serves therefore as a common topological reference of different spatial approximations rather than absolute geometric determination, for instance for relating outer or inner spatial boundaries for the respective spacetime volumes.</p>
        <p>
          In case the domain of an instance of <em>P161 has spatial projection</em> is an instance of E4 Period, the spatial projection describes all areas that period was ever present at, for instance, the Roman Empire.

          There are two typical cases for the determination of the related instance of E52 Time-Span. In the first, it is the temporal extent of an instance of E2 Temporal Entity (documented with <em>P4 has time-span (is time-span of)</em>): this then documents the simultaneity of the instance of E93 Presence and the instance of E2 Temporal Entity, even if the absolute time-span is not known, and can be regarded as a phenomenal time-span. In the second, the instance of E52 Time-Span is a date range declared in or derived from historical sources or provided by dating methods: this is a declarative time-span.

          This property associates an instance of E13 Attribute Assignment with the type of property or relation that this assignment maintains to hold between the item to which it assigns an attribute and the attribute itself. Note that the properties defined by the CIDOC CRM also constitute instances of E55 Type themselves. The direction of the assigned property of type is understood to be from the attributed item (the range of property <em>P140 assigned attribute to</em>) to the attribute item (the range of the property <em>P141 assigned</em>). More than one property type may be assigned to hold between two items.

        <p>This property associates an instance of E53 Place with another instance of E53 Place, which is defined in the same reference space, and which is used to approximate the former. The property does not necessarily state the quality or accuracy of this approximation, but rather indicates the use of the first instance of place to approximate the second.</p>
        <p>In common documentation practice, find or encounter spots e.g., in archaeology, botany or zoology are often related to the closest village, river or other named place without detailing the relation, e.g., if it is located within the village or in a certain distance of the specified place. In this case the stated “phenomenal” place found in the documentation can be seen as approximation of the actual encounter spot without more specific knowledge. </p>
        <p>
          In more recent documentation often point coordinate information is provided that originates from GPS measurements or georeferencing from a map. This point coordinate information does not state the actual place of the encounter spot but tries to approximate it with a “declarative” place. The accuracy depends on the methodology used when creating the coordinates. It may be dependent on technical limitations like GPS accuracy but also on the method where the GPS location is taken in relation to the measured feature. If the methodology is known a maximum deviation from the measured point can be calculated and the encounter spot or feature may be related to the resulting circle using an instance of <em>P171 at some place within</em>.

        <p>An instance of E18 Physical Thing not only occupies a particular geometric space at each instant of its existence, but in the course of its existence it also forms a trajectory through spacetime, which occupies a real, that is phenomenal, volume in spacetime, i.e., the instance of E92 Spacetime Volume this property associates it with. This real spatiotemporal extent of the instance of E18 Physical Thing is regarded as being unique, in all its details and fuzziness; the identity and existence of the E92 Spacetime Volume depends uniquely on the identity of the instance of E18 Physical Thing, whose existence defines it. It constitutes a phenomenal spacetime volume as defined in CRMgeo (Doerr &amp; Hiebel, 2013).</p>
        <p>Included in this spacetime volume are both the spaces filled by the matter of the physical thing and any inner space that may exist, for instance the interior of a box. Physical things consisting of aggregations of physically unconnected objects, such as a set of chessmen, occupy a finite number of individually contiguous subsets of this spacetime volume equal to the number of objects that constitute the set and that are never connected during its existence.</p>
